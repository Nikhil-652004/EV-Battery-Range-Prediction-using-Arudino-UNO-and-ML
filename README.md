# EV-Battery-Range-Prediction-using-Arudino-UNO-and-ML
In the dynamic landscape of electric vehicles (EVs), ensuring accurate and reliable predictions of battery range is paramount for enhancing user experience and optimizing vehicle performance. This project introduces an Electric Vehicle Battery Range Predictor that leverages machine learning algorithms to estimate the remaining range based on various input parameters. The system integrates sensor inputs, including current, voltage, speed, temperature, and state of charge (SOC), obtained through potentiometers, to simulate real-world conditions.

#Objectives:
• Real-time prediction: With the help of machine learning models, we were able to make quick and accurate predictions on streaming or constantly updating data.

• Machine Learning integration: Integration of machine learning into this project brings about transformative changes by automating routine tasks, improving precision, and unlocking valuable insights from data.

• Predictive maintenance: To make it easier to predict when equipment or machinery is likely to fail, allowing for timely maintenance and minimizing downtime.
